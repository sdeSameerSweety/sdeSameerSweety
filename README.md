# Sameersweety Swain - Full Stack Developer

Hey there! Welcome to my profile. I'm Sameersweety Swain, a motivated and dedicated Full Stack Developer with a background in Civil Engineering. Let me share my journey and skills with you.

## Background
I successfully completed my diploma in Civil Engineering, but I faced some challenges when it came to acquiring knowledge in the field. Determined to overcome this hurdle, I ventured into the world of Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) and utilized Google Dorking techniques to find relevant study materials. This experience sparked my curiosity and propelled me forward.

## Exploring New Avenues
During my quest for knowledge, I developed an interest in hacking. However, I quickly realized that my lack of programming expertise was holding me back. Undeterred, I dove into learning the Python programming language, dedicating myself to mastering its fundamentals. After just 10 days of focused learning, I felt confident enough to explore other programming languages.

## Bootcamp Experience
To accelerate my learning and broaden my skill set, I enrolled in the FunctionUp Backend Dev Bootcamp. This intensive program provided hands-on training and helped me gain proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Git, GitHub, AWS S3, Redis, and more. Additionally, I honed my problem-solving abilities through Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), Dynamic Programming (DP), Low-Level Design (LLD), HLS, and other essential concepts.

## Real-World Project Experience
After completing several months of training, I had the incredible opportunity to work on real-world web development projects. Collaborating with talented team members, I successfully delivered multiple projects, including:
1. Blogging Site
2. Open Internship Site
3. Short URL Site
4. Book Management Site
5. Product Management Site
6. Personal Portfolio Site

These projects allowed me to showcase my skills, work within teams, and gain valuable experience in project collaboration.
